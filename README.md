# COP4710-Databases_TermProject
Designed and developed an online enterprise management system with non-trivial functionalities using FAERS databases

This project is a collaboration with Dr. Feng Cheng, a research professor of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health at the University of South Florida. With a team of three, we helped develop an enterprise management system giving the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database.

A simple search of FAERS data cannot be performed with these files, hence this management system, FAERS Search Tool as we called it,  was designed and developed. This search tool helps the process of looking up raw data, extracted from the AERS data files a lot easier when going through the large database.

What is FAERS?

"The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is a database that contains adverse event reports, medication error reports and product quality complaints resulting in adverse events that were submitted to FDA. The database is designed to support the FDA's post-marketing safety surveillance program for drug and therapeutic biologic products. The informatic structure of the FAERS database adheres to the international safety reporting guidance issued by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH E2B). Adverse events and medication errors are coded using terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology." 
-From FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration
